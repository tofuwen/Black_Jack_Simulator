# Black_Jack_Simulator

Todo:
1. Simulate simple optimal strategy, should see 49% winning rate
2. Simulate using +1/-1 counting strategy, hopefully to see winning rate > 50%
3. Simulate soft 17, can we increase our winning rate given there are some n00bs on the table?
4. Simulate lucky, bust
5. Simulate CA black jack: give 1 to dealer every time
